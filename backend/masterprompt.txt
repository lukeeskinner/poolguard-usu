I need a json result of the form {risk: ""} where the result can be low, medium or high.
This needs to be calculated off of the safety of everyone INSIDE of the water in the image
if there is no water, simply have the risk be low.
Focus on the age of the people swimming, changes of positions inside of the pool
if there appears to be struggle or unusual behavior. just give me the JSON value,
do not give me a single other piece of text as output.
